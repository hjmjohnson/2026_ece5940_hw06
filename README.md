# ECE:5490 — HW06: Index and Physical Space Coordinate Transformations

*DUE: Monday March 30, 2026 at 11:59 PM (before the midterm exam)*

Store your completed source code in your `hw06` directory in your class GitHub repository.
An automated script will checkout, compile, and test your work, so submit on time.

## Objectives

- Understand the relationship between voxel **index space** and **physical (world) space** in ITK images
- Use all four ITK coordinate transform methods on `itk::Image`
- Build intuition for why continuous indices preserve round-trip accuracy while integer indices do not
- Prepare for the midterm exam

---

## Background

Every ITK image lives simultaneously in two coordinate spaces:

| Space | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Index space** | `ImageType::IndexType` (integers) | Voxel address `[i, j, k]` |
| **Physical space** | `ImageType::PointType` (doubles, mm) | World coordinates `(x, y, z)` |

The mapping between them is encoded in three image properties set at acquisition time:

- **Origin** — physical location of the center of the voxel that would be at index location[0,0,0]
- **Spacing** — physical size (mm) of each voxel
- **Direction** — rotation matrix aligning the image axes to the physical axes

ITK provides four methods on `itk::Image` to move between these spaces:

| Method | Input → Output |
|---|---|
| `TransformIndexToPhysicalPoint` | integer index → physical point |
| `TransformPhysicalPointToIndex` | physical point → nearest integer index |
| `TransformPhysicalPointToContinuousIndex` | physical point → fractional (continuous) index |
| `TransformContinuousIndexToPhysicalPoint` | fractional index → physical point |

The continuous index pair forms an **exact round-trip**: converting a physical point to a continuous index and back recovers the original point to floating-point precision. The integer index pair introduces **quantization error** of up to half the voxel spacing, because the fractional index is rounded to the nearest integer voxel.

## Requirements

Complete the starter file `ImageCoordinates/ImageCoordinates.cxx` by filling in each `TODO` section. Your finished program `ImageCoordinates_${MYHAWKID}` must:

1. **Part 1 — `TransformIndexToPhysicalPoint`**
   Given the command-line integer index `(indexI, indexJ, indexK)`, compute and print its physical coordinates in mm.

2. **Part 2 — `TransformPhysicalPointToIndex`**
   Given the command-line physical point `(physX, physY, physZ)`, compute and print the nearest integer index. Check the returned `bool` to confirm the point lies inside the image.

3. **Part 3 — `TransformPhysicalPointToContinuousIndex`**
   For the same physical point, compute and print the continuous (fractional) index.

4. **Part 4 — `TransformContinuousIndexToPhysicalPoint`**
   Convert the continuous index from Part 3 back to a physical point and print it.

5. **Verdddification**
   Compute and print the Euclidean distance (mm) between the original physical point and both round-trip results (via integer index and via continuous index). The continuous round-trip error must be less than `1e-6` mm.

### Command-line Usage

```bash
ImageCoordinates_hawkid \
    --inputVolume /nfsscratch/opt/ece5490/data/Eyes.nrrd \
    --indexI 60 --indexJ 127 --indexK 93 \
    --physX <px> --physY <py> --physZ <pz>
```

### Test Data

```bash
export DATA=/nfsscratch/opt/ece5490/data
```

Run your program with `$DATA/Eyes.nrrd` and the ** index** `[60, 127, 93]`:

```bash
# Step 1: use Part 1 to determine the physical coordinates of a point in the image
ImageCoordinates_hawkid --inputVolume $DATA/Eyes.nrrd \
    --indexI 60 --indexJ 127 --indexK 93 \
    --physX 0.0 --physY 0.0 --physZ 0.0

# Step 2: re-run using the physical coordinates printed in Part 1 as --physX/Y/Z input
#         to verify all four transforms round-trip correctly
```

### Expected Output Format

```
=== Image Metadata ===
Origin:    [...]
Spacing:   [...]
Direction: ...
Size:      [...]

=== Part 1: Index to Physical ===
Index     [60, 127, 93] -> Physical: [...] mm

=== Part 2: Physical to Nearest Integer Index ===
Physical  [...] -> Nearest Index: [...]

=== Part 3: Physical to Continuous Index ===
Physical  [...] -> Continuous Index: [...]

=== Part 4: Continuous Index to Physical (Round-trip) ===
Continuous Index [...] -> Physical: [...] mm

=== Verification ===
Original physical point:                 [...]
Round-trip via continuous index:         [...]
Round-trip via integer index:            [...]
Continuous index round-trip error (mm):  <should be < 1e-6>
Integer index round-trip error (mm):     <may be non-zero>
```

## Essay Questions

```txt
# Essay Question 1:
# In Part 2, when you convert the physical coordinates of Index [60, 127, 93] back
# to an integer index using TransformPhysicalPointToIndex, do you always recover [60, 127, 93]
# exactly? Explain why or why not, referencing the voxel spacing of Eyes.nrrd.

# << Your answer here >>
```

```txt
# Essay Question 2:
# Explain why the continuous index round-trip error (Part 4) is essentially zero while
# the integer index round-trip error may not be. Under what specific condition would
# the integer round-trip also be exact?

# << Your answer here >>
```

```txt
# Essay Question 3:
# The midterm exam asks you to compute the distance between two eyes in physical space
# given their index locations. Why is it incorrect to compute this distance directly
# in index space using index subtraction, and when would it accidentally give the right answer?

# << Your answer here >>
